## 🎯 Overview

This isn't your typical developer portfolio. It's an interactive narrative that visualizes my unconventional career path through a vertical journey, starting 250 meters below the ocean surface and ascending into the cosmos of digital innovation.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Scroll-Driven Storytelling**: Navigate through 5 distinct environmental zones
- **3D WebGL Experience**: Real-time particle systems and dynamic lighting
- **Project Discovery**: Interactive project spheres reveal details on proximity
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop and mobile
- **Performance Optimized**: Smooth 60fps animations with thousands of particles

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and WebGL rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No framework overhead, pure performance
- **Custom Particle Systems** - 6 unique particle zones with ~7,000 particles
- **Dynamic Fog & Lighting** - Environment changes based on depth
- **CSS3 Animations** - UI elements and transitions

## 🎮 Navigation

- **Scroll** - Ascend/descend through the journey
- **Mouse Movement** - Parallax camera effects
- **Navigation Bar** - Quick jump to specific zones
- **Depth Meter** - Visual progress indicator

## 🌍 Journey Zones

1. **The Abyss** (-250m) - Marine science foundations
2. **Deep Ocean** (-150m) - Biostatistics and underwater research
3. **Surface** (0m) - Transformation point
4. **Atmosphere** (+100m) - Current projects and real-time systems
5. **Digital Space** (+250m) - AI and future innovations

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **Q-DRIVE Cortex** - Real-time driving simulator with Hardware-in-the-Loop integration
- **Vision Perception Systems** - Advanced computer vision and VLM pipelines
- **Marine Habitat Detection** - Award-winning ecological monitoring system
- **Coastal Risk Intelligence** - Environmental impact scoring with LSTM networks
- **Real-Time Data Pipelines** - High-performance stream processing architectures

## 💡 Design Philosophy

The vertical journey metaphor represents:
- **Depth = Foundation**: Deep expertise in biological systems
- **Surface = Transformation**: Where two worlds meet
- **Space = Innovation**: Limitless possibilities in AI/tech

This portfolio demonstrates that the same systems thinking required to understand ocean ecosystems translates powerfully to architecting AI systems and data pipelines.
